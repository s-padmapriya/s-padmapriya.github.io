As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long it is alive; a lack of problems foreshadows extinction or the cessation of independent development. 
                                                        - DavidHilbert, 1900

I am a curious learner exploring the interface of Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics. Teaching or communicating ideas is the best way of learning. As I unravel and learn new things in the domain of quantum computing, quantum algorithms and, complexity theory and also its classical counterparts, I will pen down my notes, learning and will make a repository for myself and other fellow learners.
